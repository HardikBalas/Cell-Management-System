I developed this project as part of the 'AI/ML and Electric Vehicles' course offered by the Edunet Foundation at our college. The course taught us how electric vehicles work and how artificial intelligence can be applied in EV systems, such as cell management and performance analysis.

This is a Cell Management System website used to test, charge, and discharge battery cells. It provides detailed analysis and visualization of cell performance and allows users to execute specific tasks such as charging profiles or discharge cycles.

The website is built using Python, leveraging frameworks like Streamlit for the frontend and backendÂ integration.
